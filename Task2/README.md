    2.Modify the Jenkins job to build a Docker image of the "Hello World" application.
    3.Extend the Jenkins job to include automated testing of the "Hello World" application.
    4.Rewrite the Jenkins job configuration using a Jenkinsfile. Include stages to build, test and deploy the application in docker.
